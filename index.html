            PLAN B developed in India during ancient times as royal houses where royal guests would stay and be entertained.
            In later era, they were considered merchant homes or homes of the wealthy.
            Their initial evolution was where the royal families and selected ministers got together in a friendly
            environment to discuss affairs of the state, as they dined and were entertained. The custom welcomed hundreds
            of the best cooks and entertainers to be brought from around the state to serve the royal families and their
            guests. The entertainment and the food was always the best the state had to offer.
            The numbers of cooks were known to try new and creative dishes to distinguish themselves before the royal family.
            It is because of this beginning that Haveli's over time became known as keepers of Indian traditions and cuisines.
